**ðŸŒŸ Push_swap**

A project aimed at sorting a stack of integers using a minimal number of operations. This project helped me improve my algorithm design, stack manipulation, and optimization skills in C.

**ðŸ“‹ Project Overview**

Push_swap is a sorting algorithm project where I had to implement efficient ways to sort a stack using a limited set of operations. The project is based on the 1337 curriculum and allowed me to explore advanced data structure manipulation and algorithmic optimizations.

**ðŸ”§ Features**

Operations: Implements sa, sb, pa, pb, ra, rra, and more for sorting.

Optimization: Focused on minimizing the number of operations for sorting the stack.

Algorithmic Design: Uses methods like Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) to determine efficient sorting paths.


**ðŸ“‚ Operations List**

sa: Swap the first two elements of stack A.

sb: Swap the first two elements of stack B.

ss: Perform sa and sb at the same time.

pa: Push the top element of stack B to stack A.

pb: Push the top element of stack A to stack B.

ra: Rotate stack A upwards.

rb: Rotate stack B upwards.

rr: Perform ra and rb at the same time.

rra: Rotate stack A downwards.

rrb: Rotate stack B downwards.

rrr: Perform rra and rrb at the same time.
